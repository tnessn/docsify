# Welcome to the PlatON Wiki

> The wiki covering all things related to PlatON.

This is the community maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the high-efficiency trustless computing network built by the PlatON Foundation.

## Getting started

To get the basic concepts of PlatON visit [https://www.platon.network](https://www.platon.network/). For another introduction targeted for end users but also for developers and others, see [Introduction]([English]Introduction). If you want to get a deeper understanding, start by reading the [en-us/[English]Whitepaper]. If you are interested in being a core developer, find a project that interests you, and start contributing to that (maybe pro-bono initially, until maintainers like you and decide to hire you). For PlatON research and protocol architecture, visit [Technologies]. If you are interested in developing smart contracts you can see [Development].
