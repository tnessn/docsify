**Note : Contract Bytecode**

*Wasm contract can be written with the contract development framework (reference [link to be confirmed]). After compiling, you can get a binary code file suffixed with .wasm, which is an executable instruction of the virtual machine, and the execution of the contract logic is completed by instruction sets on the virtual machine.*

**Note: Contract ABI (Interface)**

*After the contract being compiled, an ABI file suffixed with .json will also be generated. ABI is the abbreviation of Application Binary Interface, which can be understood as a contract interface description. after the contract being compiled, its corresponding ABI is also formed. ABI is somewhat similar to the interface definition in the program, describing the field name, field type, method name, parameter name, parameter type, method return value type etc.*
