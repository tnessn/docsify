**Notes: Wallet safety**

1. *The password is used for encrypting the wallet key file. Please make sure to memorize the wallet password. Lost of password means lost of your wallet,  and cannot be recovered, since the server doesn’t store your password as well. So never lost the wallet password.*

2. *Disk damage, system re-installation, or mistaken deletion will result in the loss of .json file. Therefor, be sure to back up the encrypted .json file or the private key in plain text, and ensure they won’t be leaked, deleted or lost. Once lost, the wallet cannot be retrieved.*
